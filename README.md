# Coffee-Sales

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales using Excel, focusing on key metrics such as order dates, roast type, coffee size, and loyalty card usage. The analysis includes a breakdown of total sales over time, a comparison of sales across countries, and identification of the top five customers. This project aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, offering valuable information for improving sales strategies and customer engagement.
